            <p>Dearest Anushka,</p><p>
Dearest Anushka,
The bonus chapter is as simple as my letters where i adore every single bit of you. I wanted it to be as special as your existence. In oder to do so, i chose this bizzare way instead. I hope you have not had trouble opening it and if you have, then i might as well should make it trouble-worthy. Looking back at what we were,what we are right now in the present and what we might be ahead in life, it all makes sense to me, yes GG our journey takes all the cups. Now that i sit and think, a 12 year old entering the halls of a boarding school would have never made it without you anushka,it was all because of you. You said i made your life easier but GG, you MADE my life. I love everything we do together even things that are just related to you, i enjoy and savor every bit of it. I know i made mistakes in the past and i did things we both regret, but i hope to create a space where we love and grow together and mistakes like those are never made again. 
  
</p>
            <p>The victories,the joys,the sorrows,the pain, everything that we shared will forever be etched in my heart anushka. I dont know how to describe this feeling-joy filled with fear. Fear, terrifying yet beautiful, it makes us achieve and lose. I am certain that our future would be bright, but i fear because i might not be there to witness the success youll achieve but whatever happens tomorrow, the memories we made and the bond we created will forever be cherished by my soul,wholly. I would always be there to look out for you anushka. Ive always found you intruiguing, somebody whoâ€™s worth the world. I love every single part of you but what i love the most is your teeth. I believe that it is your teeth that reflects your genuiness to the people, it potrays your purity and lets us have a taste of it. I may not be the best friend you meet,i know i cant be, i know i am not perfect but i wish to make every single day we spend together perfect.  I never thought someone would actually make me understand how it is to love a person this much. But i can say it now, i know how loves feels like and its all because of you,i love you, till the moon and back. 
</p>
            <p>Until next time</p>
<p>You and I</p>
<p>It would always be</p>
<p>From Sik to GG<3</p>
